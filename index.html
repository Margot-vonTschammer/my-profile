			<h2>Skiing🎿</h2>
			<p> Having lived in Grenoble in the Alps for 15 years, I was used to skiing from a very young age during weekends and school holidays.  Obviously, since I left for Nantes in 2016, it has been difficult for me to return more than two weeks a year. 
			However, I really enjoy these ski trips, it allows me to find myself where I grew up, to evacuate the stress and to find the sporting values in which I have evolved. I ski alone, with family or friends.

			<h2>Trips🌍 ✈️</h2>
			<p> I was able to discover different cultures that allowed me to have an open mind but also taught me to respect others and accept our differences.
			This curiosity of discovery through travel has led me to organize trips with friends but also to work abroad.

			<h2>Music 🎶</h2>
			<p> I really enjoy music. Indeed, I like to follow a group and observe its evolution. I was able to attend many concerts. 
			In addition to being a passion, I would like to point out that it is partly through music that I learned English. Being attached to American culture, I have always been interested in understanding the lyrics of the songs.
